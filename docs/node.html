<span class="sectionMark">&sect; 1</span>

<p>Yes <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node</a> does. That loader uses the CommonJS module format. The CommonJS module format is <a href="why.html">non-optimal for the browser</a>, and I do not prefer <a href="http://tagneto.blogspot.com/2010/03/commonjs-module-trade-offs.html">some of the trade-offs made in the CommonJS module format</a>. By using RequireJS on the server, you can use one format for all your modules, whether they are running server side or in the browser. That way you can preserve the speed benefits and easy debugging you get with RequireJS in the browser, and not have to worry about extra translation costs for moving between two formats.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>
<a name="2">Can I use server modules already written in the CommonJS module format?</a>
<span class="sectionMark">&sect; 2</span></h2>

<p>Yes! The Node adapter for RequireJS, called r.js, automatically converts CommonJS modules on the fly to a format usable by RequireJS, as they are loaded, so you can use your existing Node-based modules without having to hand-modify them.</p>

<p>However, the top most app file, the one you pass to Node on startup, needs to be coded to the RequireJS API. That file is evaluated as-is, no automatic format conversion.</p>

<p>You can use modules installed by <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a>, or use the <a href="api.html#config">Configuration Options</a> for RequireJS in your top level app file to configure paths, package pages, and even a different baseUrl for your modules.</p>

<p>RequireJS will use its configuration first to find modules, then use require.paths to search for the module, then if it is not found, it will look in the internal cache of modules built into Node.</p>

<p>RequireJS does not support require.main and the module free variable only contains an <strong>id</strong> property. It does not define a require.async method, since require() in RequireJS can accept equivalent arguments.</p>

<p>Even though RequireJS is an asynchronous loader in the browser, the RequireJS Node adapter loads modules synchronously in the Node environment to match the default loading behavior in Node.</p>

<p>Finally, RequireJS in Node can only load modules that are on the local disk -- fetching modules across http, for instance, is not supported at this time.</p>

<h2>
<a name="3">How do I use it?</a>
<span class="sectionMark">&sect; 3</span>
</h2>

<p>Download r.js from the <a href="download.html#node">the download page</a> and place it on your disk somewhere. Then run this command:</p>

<pre><code>node path/to/r.js myNodeApp.js
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes you are in the directory that contains myNodeApp.js, your top-level Node application file.</p>

<p>That is it!</p>

<p>If you want to try a sample app that works with r.js, see the index.js Hello World app on <a href="download.html#node">the download page</a>.</p>

<p>If you get a load failure, you can pass <strong>debug</strong> after r.js to get some information on what modules were attempted to be loaded and from what location:</p>

<pre><code>node path/to/r.js debug myNodeApp.js
</code></pre>

<p>If you find you have a problem, and want to report it, use the <a href="http://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/issues">RequireJS GitHub Issues page</a>. If you can attach the output of the <strong>debug</strong> run, that would be helpful.</p>

<p>If you want to discuss the RequireJS-Node integration, you can use the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/requirejs">RequireJS Group</a>.</p>
